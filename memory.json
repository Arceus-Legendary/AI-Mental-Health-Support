    "text": "A favicon's location depends on how a website is set up.  There's no single, universal \"haha where is favicon\" answer.  However, it's usually found in one of these places:\n\n* **In the website's root directory:**  This is the most common location.  Look for a small image file (typically named `favicon.ico`, but it could also be a `.png` or other image format) in the main folder of the website's files.\n\n* **Referenced in the website's HTML `<head>`:** The website's HTML code (usually in the `<head>` section) will contain a `<link>` tag that points to the favicon's location. This tag will look something like this:\n\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" type=\"image/x-icon\">\n   ```  or\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.png\" type=\"image/png\">\n   ```\n   The `href` attribute shows the path to the favicon file.  The path can be relative (like `/favicon.ico`) or absolute (like `https://www.example.com/favicon.ico`).\n\n* **In a subdirectory:**  Sometimes, websites store their favicon in an \"images\" or \"assets\" folder.\n\n\nTo find the favicon for a *specific* website, you'll need to look at its source code (right-click on the page and select \"View Page Source\" or a similar option) or use your browser's developer tools to inspect the network requests.  The developer tools often allow you to see all the resources loaded by a page, including the favicon."
